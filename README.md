# cs-algorithms
Python package with common sorting algorithms and data structures 


## Current functionality
* Sroting:
    * is_sorted
        
        Check if a given array is sorted (works for ascending and descending order).

    * bubble_sort_original
        
        Repeatedly swapping the adjacent elements if they are in wrong order.

    * bubble_sort_optimized

        Repeatedly swapping the adjacent elements if they are in wrong order (stops when array is sorted).

    * selection_sort

        Repeatedly finding the minimum element (considering ascending order) from unsorted part and putting it at the beginning. 

    * insertion_sort

        The array is virtually split into a sorted and an unsorted part. Values from the unsorted part are picked and placed at the correct position in the sorted part.
    * merge_sort

        It divides the input array into two halves, calls itself for the two halves, and then merges the two sorted halves. 

    * quick_sort

        It picks an element as pivot and partitions the given array around the picked pivot. 
        
* Data Structures:
    * None
